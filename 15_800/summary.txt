Based on the provided images from the sensitivity analysis, here's an interpretation and summary of the results:

    pCancerMult - Bacteria Cells and Immune Cells:
        As the pCancerMult (probability of cancer cell multiplication) increases, the average bacteria cell count peaks
        earlier and at a higher level before declining, indicating that a higher multiplication rate accelerates the growth
         and subsequent decline of bacteria.
        For immune cells, higher pCancerMult values lead to a slower increase in immune cell count, suggesting that
        faster cancer cell multiplication may suppress or delay the immune response.

    pCancerSpawn - Bacteria Cells and Immune Cells:
        Variations in pCancerSpawn (probability of cancer cell spawning) appear to have less dramatic effects on bacteria
        cell dynamics, with all curves peaking and declining in a similar fashion. However, higher values tend to sustain bacteria cell counts for longer, indicating a more prolonged presence of bacteria cells with increased cancer cell spawning.
        For immune cells, the effect of pCancerSpawn also seems less pronounced, but higher values lead to a marginally
        higher immune cell count, possibly due to a greater stimulus for the immune system.

    pImmuneKill - Bacteria Cells and Immune Cells:
        Increasing the pImmuneKill (probability of an immune cell killing a cancer cell) leads to a significant decrease
        in bacteria cell counts. Higher values lead to a rapid and more substantial decline in bacteria cells, reflecting the increased effectiveness of the immune response.
        For immune cells, higher pImmuneKill values result in an earlier and higher peak in immune cell counts, followed
        by a plateau. This indicates that a more effective immune response rapidly controls the bacteria cell population and then maintains a consistent level of immune presence.

Summary:

    Cancer Cell Multiplication (pCancerMult): Higher rates of cancer cell multiplication can lead to a more aggressive
    onset of bacteria presence but may suppress or delay the immune response.
    Cancer Cell Spawning (pCancerSpawn): Changes in cancer cell spawning have a less substantial impact but generally
    promote a more sustained bacteria presence and a slightly increased immune response.
    Immune Cell Killing Probability (pImmuneKill): Higher effectiveness of the immune system in killing cancer cells
    results in a more controlled bacteria population and a robust immune presence.

These results highlight the complex interplay between cancer cell dynamics and the immune response. Modifying each
 parameter affects the system differently, indicating potential targets for therapeutic intervention. For example,
 increasing the effectiveness of immune cells (pImmuneKill) seems to be a potent strategy for controlling cancer cell
 proliferation.
